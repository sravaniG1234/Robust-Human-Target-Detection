# ROBUST HUMAN TARGET DETECTION
The Robust Human Target Detection system is an innovative project designed to automate and streamline the identification process using advanced facial recognition techniques. This project leverages the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to accurately detect and recognize human targets in real-time, making it suitable for applications such as smart surveillance, automated attendance, and human tracking systems.
